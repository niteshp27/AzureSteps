Microsoft Azure style steps.

I have taken the Jquery Steps Wizard plugin and extended it to implement a Microsoft Azure Style Slider Steps on top of this wizard.
You need to first call the Jquery Steps Wizard and then call the Azure Steps plugin as you can find it in the demo html file.

You can fins the Jquery Steps Plugin here: http://www.jquery-steps.com/
